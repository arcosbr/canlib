SDK Installation
========================================================================

Note that the CANLIB SDK should not be installed on top of an already
installed, older edition of CANLIB SDK. You should install into a new
directory, or uninstall the old version.

In contrast, the driver package may be installed over an old
installation of the drivers.



Known Problems and Limitations
========================================================================
* Downgrading CANlib drivers from v5.21 and above, to v5.20 or lower must be
  done by first un-installing the current version, and then installing the
  wanted version.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.46   (18-SEP-2024)
===========================================================================
* SDK (kvlclib)
    Channel (##CN) blocks in exported MDF 4.1 signal based files
    (KVLC_FILE_FORMAT_MDF_4X_SIGNAL) now get a Source Information (##SI)
    block with si_tx_path = CAN{channel_nr} to identify the channel.

* SDK (kvadblib)
  - Changed parser to generate warnings for unrecognized DBC keywords
    it skips.

* SDK (kvmlib)
  - Made kvmKmeWriteEvent error if the message byte length does not
    map to a DLC, instead of proceeding with a faulty value.
  - Changed kvmKmeWriteEvent to return more specific kvmERR_xxx errors
    than kvmFail when applicable.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.45   (22-MAY-2024)
===========================================================================
* SDK (kvadblib)
  - Made more lenient w.r.t. type mismatches between attribute values

===========================================================================
* J2534
  - Fixed a bug which prevented protocols FD_ISO15765_CH2 through
    FD_ISO15765_CH128 from working correctly.
  - Allowed for the individual frames of ISO 15765 to be seen as loopback
    messages if both LOOPBACK and CAN "mixed format" are on. As per the
    standard:
    - "If the configuration setting LOOPBACK is set to ON, then transmitted
      messages (including flow control) shall be processed in the same
      manner as received messages."
  - Fix: Timestamps returned from the API are now correctly using
    microseconds as the unit.
  - New devices will now be available to connect to after a call to
    PassThruOpen(), rather than having to use the KV_REINIT_CANLIB ioctl.
  - If PassThruRead() is called with timeout=0, ERR_TIMEOUT is no longer
    returned.
  - Support for virtual CANlib channels extended
    - Virtual channels now supported on CAN, CAN FD, ISO-TP, and ISO-TP FD
      channels rather than just CAN and ISO-TP. (Virtual channels must still
      be enabled with the J2534 Options Tool before they can be used.)
    - When calling PassThruConnect() on a virtual channel without having
      enabled use of virtual channels, the DLL now returns
      ERR_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED.

* CANlib
  - Bus parameter checks in CANlib has been reduced in order to support more
    hardware. CANlib will issue a canERR_NOT_SUPPORTED (-19) status
    code if the parameters are not valid for the current device.
  - Added support for U100 devices in Kvaser Customer Data Utility.
  - Fixed a bug concerning a change of size of VCAN_IOCTL_GET_CHANNEL_INFO.
  - Updated the documentation of the file handling API (kvFile).
  - Updated the kvDiag API and its documentation.

    canFD_BITRATE_8M_80P.
  - Added support for J1939 databases.

* SDK (kvlclib)
  - Added support for a newer version of the BLF format (4.9.4.0), which
    contains CAN FD support. The new converter format
    KVLC_FILE_FORMAT_VECTOR_BLF_FD has both read and write capabilities.
  - Added property KVLC_PROPERTY_COMPRESSION_LEVEL to formats
    KVLC_FILE_FORMAT_MDF_4X and KVLC_FILE_FORMAT_MDF_4X_SIGNAL. The
    property represents zlib compression levels.
  - A call to kvlcSetProperty() with a property that is not supported by
    the converter now returns kvlcERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
  - Added check if any file named filename-partxx.xxx exists when
    splitting files. If any such files exists in the output folder, no files
    will be created, and kvlcERR_FILE_EXISTS is returned.
  - When converting from MDF4 to another format, kvlclib now makes sure
    the file originated from kvlclib. If it is from another tool,
    kvlcERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION is returned.

* SDK (kvadblib)
  - Corrected bug where functions to retrieve signal values
    (kvaDbRetrieveSignalXxx) would not always retreive values even though the
    signal was available in the provided data.
  - Increased stability when using kvaDbGetNextMsg() and kvaDbGetNextNode().

* SDK (canlib)
  - Added functions kvBitrateToBusParamsTq() and kvBitrateToBusParamsFdTq(),
    that translates bitrate constants to new bus parameters kvBusParamsTq.
  - Updated canlib to mitigate a crash occurring when calling canEnumHardwareEx
    on a system where all virtual channels have been uninstalled, and no
    physical interfaces are attached.
  - Updated the documentation of the file handling API (kvFile).
  - Added bitrate constant canFD_BITRATE_8M_80P.
  - Enhanced support of TRDC, allowing data rate prescaler greater than 2.
  - When canOPEN_NO_INIT_ACCESS is passed to canOpenChannel(), no additional
    argument flags, canOPEN_xxx, are needed in order to get a valid handle.

* TRX
  - Fixed problem with file association causing .t .tprj and .txe files not
    to open correctly if there are spaces in the file path.
  - Added support for assigning logical names to a dbc file.

* WiFi Pairing Tool
  - Removed Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 runtime dependency introduced in v5.28.

* Added support for new device:
  - Kvaser USBcan Pro 4xHS  (01261-5)


New Features and Fixed Problems in V5.34   (09-SEP-2020)
===========================================================================
* SDK (canlib)
  - New bus parameter API using time quanta, see e.g. canSetBusParamsTq().
  - kvScriptEnvvarOpen()'s 'envvarName' parameter and kvScriptEnvvarSetData()'s
    'buf' parameter have been changed to const.

  in Samples\candb. API documentation is in the CANLIB help file.

* A driver for COTI (CANopen Testing Interface) is included.
  See http://www.can-cia.de/index.php?id=conformance for more information.

* 64-bit versions of linlib.dll and j1587lib.dll are included.

* Users of Dell Latitude 6410 laptops together with LAPcan might need to
  run PcmciaIrqRouteToPciController.reg and lapcan_resource_filter.js.

* Fixed a bug where canReadSpecific would leave a "ghost message" in the
  queue. Further calls to canRead would return canERR_NOMSG but when
  reading the queue level, 1 would be returned.

* canlibCLSNET.dll: when using canIoCtl to get the EAN number, the DLL
  now returns an unsigned 64-bit integer that contains the EAN,
  BCD-coded in a hex string. Earlier version always returned an error
  code.

* filo_setparam_userdata.exe: Fixed hex number parsing bug for
  the -data argument.

* kcanl.sys: Fixed missing "break" that would cause the autotransmit
  buffers to misbehave if the user parameters were read.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.2 (Release 15-OCT-2009)
======================================================================

* This driver version is needed to use Kvaser Memorator Light.

* linlib.dll now exports the linGetCanHandle, linSetupIllegalMessage
  and linSetupLIN APIs properly (without "name mangling")



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.1a (Release 1-JUN-2009)
======================================================================

* IMPORTANT for Kvaser Blackbird setup program: In this release
  changes were made that will require at least firmware 1.9.950. Older
  Blackbird firmware will not work. Also note that old configurations
  can not be read into the setup program. You must recreate the
  configurations.

* Kvaser Blackbird setup program: New channel selection user
  interface. The "automatic" choice is now replaced by "Search all
  channels".

* Kvaser Blackbird setup program: Added China as a regulatory domain.

* Kvaser BlackBird: communication protocol slightly changed to improve
  both latency and throughput.

* (General) Fixed bug where the value returned by
  canIOCTL_GET_TIMER_SCALE was wrong unless it was first set by a call
  to canIOCTL_SET_TIMER_SCALE.  (#1693)

* (General) Fixed problem where the length of the outstanding transmit
  queue was incorrectly calculated, causing an overflow after sending
  more than 10240 messages without calling any other API than canWrite.
  (#1380)

* Support for OEM products 00527-3, 00536-5 and 00541-9.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.1 (Release 5-MAR-2009)
======================================================================

* Support for Kvaser Memorator Light and several new Kvaser Leaf types.

* Kvaser Blackbird: The setup tool now allows for using WPA2 when
  connecting to access points configured for both WPA and WPA2.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0e (Release 14-NOV-2008)
======================================================================

* All PCI boards: Fixed a problem that prevented computer shutdown at
  certain occasion. The computer would just ignore shutdown, hang, or
  even crash during a regular system shutdown.


New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0d (Release 4-SEP-2008)
======================================================================

* Fixed a problem where the channel assignments (for Vector CANalyzer)
  were not writable from Kvaser Hardware.

* Fixed problem with registry protection on certain keys in 64-bit Vista.
  This caused problems with the proxy driver that Kvaser BlackBird uses.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0c (Release 8-JUL-2008)
======================================================================

* Compared to 4.0b, this release contains no changes visible to the
  end users - only changes to certain manufacturing software are made.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0b (Release 27-MAY-2008)
======================================================================

* Kvaser BlackBird support: Fixed a problem with Kvaser Network Setup
  and the enumeration service (used for Kvaser BlackBird) where a
  registry key sometimes got a too restrictive protection.  This caused
  the Network Setup to fail updating the list of BlackBirds on the
  network and that would prohibit connections from the service to the
  BlackBird.

* Kvaser BlackBird support: Kvaser Network Setup will now issue an error
  message if the registry keys we just mentioned cannot be written.

* canlib32.dll: Added a missing DeleteCriticalSection when the DLL
  unloads to balance the InitCriticalSection which is called when the
  DLL initializes.

* RP1210 support: Added GetLastErrorMsg and ReadDetailedVersion calls.
  Added BlackBird support.

* canlib32NET.dll, canlibCLSNET.dll: Added a strong name to the
  assembly.

* Kvaser BlackBird support: the parameter setter program now allows
  access to the built-in web server to be configured.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0a (Release 20-APR-2008)
======================================================================

* Added support for Kvaser BlackBird.

* Fixed bug in canWaitForEvent that happened in 64-bit Windows only,
  although it was probably present also in Win32

* J2534 library: 1. Implemented timestamps for TxDone-indications. 2.
  Implemented ExtraDataIndex for all messages and indications. 3. Return
  correct value of read messages when reading fails.

* SDK: Added J1699/3 test application from Sourceforge; see
  samples/J1699 Added a fix in VerifyBatteryVoltage so it can handle the
  case when READ_VBATT isn't supported.

* Restored support for PCIcan/PCIcanx with Kone transceivers.



New Features and Fixed Problems in V4.0 (Release 2-FEB-2008)
======================================================================

* Kvaser Leaf, OEM versions: Fixed a BSOD in the driver when a certain
  third party software (for whiteboards) was installed on the same
  machine.

* SDK: Several small documentation improvements

* RP1210: Support for changing the baud rate on the ClientConnect call.

* RP1210: Added the ability to remove the "Serial=" in the DeviceParams
  line of a Device Block.  If a serial number is not provided in this
  line, the first channel that matches the hardware type and the
  required "Chan=" value is assigned to the device id.

* RP1210: Added the ability to define a baud rate on the DeviceParams
  line of the Device Block.  This allows legacy rp1210A code to use a
  baud rate other than 250.

* RP1210: Updated the INI file to have comments and match the latest
  RP1210B specification.

* For RP1210B please note: ReadDetailedVersion(), GetLastErrorMsg(),
  Set Broadcast List command are yet not supported

* J1587: The library functions j1587WriteMessageWait() and
  j1587ReadMessageWait() are rewritten to avoid losing incomming
  messages on a channel used for both reading and writing.

* The J1587 library has a new implementation that is more robust and
  should eliminate the certain timeout errors seen in the previous
  release.

* Corrected typo in INF files that could cause the PCI104 to get wrong
  driver when installed.
