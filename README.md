/*
 * This repository is a simple fork of the Kvaser CANlib to allow CAN communication
 * through the Kvaser Virtual CAN Driver or any compatible CAN device. The original
 * functionality provided by the Kvaser CANlib is preserved, with some adaptations
 * for easier integration in specific environments. This fork doesn't add new
 * features but makes CANlib accessible for different setups.
