# Kvaser CANlib Fork

This repository is a **simple fork** of the Kvaser CANlib to enable CAN communication through the **Kvaser Virtual CAN Driver** or any compatible CAN device. The original functionality of the Kvaser CANlib is maintained, with some minor adaptations for easier integration in specific environments.

### Notes:
- No new features have been added.
- The goal is to make CANlib more accessible for different setups.

For detailed documentation, refer to the official [Kvaser CANlib documentation](https://kvaser.com/canlib-webhelp/)
